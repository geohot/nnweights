Crappy MNIST autoencoder to do weight learning on

784-32-784

sample/sgdweights has W, b, Wp, bp

Autoencoder is run like

m = np.tanh(np.dot(x, W) + b)
y = np.dot(m, Wp) + bp

MSE loss is 0.5122 on mnist train after training for 20 epochs

Drops to 0.5076 after 100 epochs. What is the theoretical minimum?

Currently losing to PCA, which has MSE of 0.49
